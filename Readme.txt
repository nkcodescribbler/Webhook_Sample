About Webhook:
A webhook is a mechanism that allows one system to send real-time data to another system when certain events occur.
It's often used in event-driven architectures to notify external systems or applications about changes or updates without requiring those systems to constantly poll for new information.

Webhook itself is not formally categorized as a "design pattern" in the traditional software design pattern sense (like Singleton, Observer, or Factory), it does embody certain principles and concepts commonly found in design patterns.

A webhook is essentially a callback mechanism where one system sends real-time updates or data to another system via an HTTP request when specific events occur. 
It follows concepts similar to the Observer design pattern, where an event source (subject) notifies registered listeners (observers) about changes or events.

Benefits:
1) Eliminates the need for constant polling, providing instant updates.
2) Reduces server load since you only receive updates when events occur.
3) Decouples systems and allows asynchronous communication.
